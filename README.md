# ZJUBCA.EOSToolkit
A toolkit for the EOS network powered by ZJUBCA, based on [EOSToolkit](https://github.com/eostoolkit/eostoolkit).

Thanks [GenerEOS](https://www.genereos.io/) for providing such a great project.

## Features
The toolkit adds several features based on the original toolkit:
- Keypairs generation and self-create account with the help of a **private signup helper**.
- A market for decentralized applications.
- ZJUBCA whitepaper. Working in progress. 

## Develop Guide
1.  Clone this repo
2.  Run `yarn` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
3.  Run `yarn run format:js` prior to making commits for nice clean code    
4.  Run `npm run build` to build the deployable package.

Now you're ready to rumble!
